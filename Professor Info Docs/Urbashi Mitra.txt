Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, 1994, Princeton University, Priceton, NJ.
Urbashi Mitra received the B.S. and the M.S. degrees from the University of California at Berkeley in 1987 (high honors) and 1989 respectively, both in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. From 1989 until 1990 she worked as a Member of Technical Staff at Bellcore in Red Bank, NJ. In 1994, she received her Ph.D. from Princeton University in Electrical Engineering. From 1994 to 2000, Dr. Mitra was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. She became an Associate Professor in 2000.  She joined the University of Southern California in 2001 and was promoted to Full Professor in 2005.  She was a Dean's Professor of Electrical Engineering from 2015 to 2017; she is currently the Gordon S. Marshall Chair in Engineeirng.

At the University of Southern California, Dr. Mitra is a member of the Communication Sciences Institute, the Signal and Image Processing Institute, and the Bridge Institute; she holds a courtesy appointment in the Department of Computer Science.

# research_summary

Research Summary My research has focussed on problems in communication theory, information theory, and signal processing. While my early work centered on wireless communication systems as motivated by commercial applications, my current research endeavors to address fundamental questions at the boundaries of communication, estimation, and control for science. Early work on wireless communications focused on point-to-point communication (transmitter to receiver) which then evolved to recognize that methods had to be designed for networks of users. We are now at a point where we must consider networks wherein communication, sensing and control must be jointly designed. Key applications in which we
