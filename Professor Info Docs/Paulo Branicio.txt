# position

Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science

# biography

Professor Branicio's background is in high performance computing, applied math, materials physics, and materials science and engineering. His graduate research was focused on atomistic simulations of metallic nanowires, and semiconductors. As a postdoctoral researcher at the Louisiana State University and University of Southern California, he mastered the state of the art of large-scale parallel molecular dynamics algorithms and visualization techniques for analysis of massive simulation data. He has carried out the first realistic atomistic simulation of hypervelocity impact on high performance ceramic materials and coatings using parallel molecular dynamics.
