# position

Professor of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and Biomedical Engineering

# biography

Dr. Applegate received his Ph.D. in physical chemistry from The Ohio State University. He won a National Institutes of Health postdoctoral fellowship grant to continue his training at Duke University in biomedical engineering under the guidance of Professor Joe Izatt. His fellowship was focused on developing molecular imaging approaches for Optical Coherence Tomography. Upon completing his fellowship, he joined the faculty of Texas A&M University where he worked for 12 years advancing to the rank of Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering. 
There he continued his work in developing new imaging technologies, eventually focusing on applications for functional imaging of the ear. In 2019 he moved to the University of Southern California, accepting an appointment in Otolaryngology–Head&Neck Surgery where he joined his long time collaborator to continue their work on functional imaging of the ear. Throughout his career, his work has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, including the NSF Career award, the Department of Defense, and the National Institutes of Health.  In 2016 he was elected a fellow of the Optical Society of America. He has served as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging and Optics Letters. In addition to substantial service as an ad hoc grant reviewer for various national and international agencies, he is a standing member of the Imaging Guided Interventions and Surgery [IGIS] study section at the National Institutes of Health.

# research_summary

Research Summary Our research interests are broadly to develop novel biophotonic technologies for point-of-care diagnosis and monitoring of human disease as well as the basic scientific understanding of human disease. Our primary application area is functional imaging of the middle and inner ear. We are working toward advanced diagnostics for patient care as well as advanced imaging systems for probing the fundamental mechanics of the ear.
