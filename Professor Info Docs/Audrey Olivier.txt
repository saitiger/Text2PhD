# biography

Dr. Olivier holds a Diplôme d'Ingénieur (2013) from École Centrale de Nantes, France, and a M.S. (2013) and Ph.D. (2017) in Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics from Columbia University, New York. Her doctoral work focused on the development of probabilistic data analytics tools for Structural Health Monitoring and damage detection applications. During her postdoctoral appointment (2018-2020) at the Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute, Johns Hopkins University, she worked on the development of Scientific Machine Learning algorithms for materials modeling applications. As an Associate Research Scientist at Columbia University (2020-2021), she worked on data analytics tools for optimization of emergency medical services deployment in the greater New York City area.

# research_summary

Research Summary Dr. Olivier's research interests lie at the intersection of physics-based modeling, data analytics and uncertainty quantification, and the potential they hold to help build the resilient and smart urban environments of tomorrow. In Structural Health Monitoring, sensing data is used to monitor a structure's behavior and detect potential damage at its onset. Rapidly evolving trends such as increased urbanization or intensification of climate-related hazards generate considerable loads on our aging infrastructure, motivating the need for reliable health monitoring and damage detection techniques for better infrastructure management. In a smart-city context, probabilistic data analytics tools can also be leveraged
