Research Summary Topological methods in robust control: control of (biological) chaos, quantum control (decoherence control), control of noncommutative dynamics. Coarse geometry methods in networks: network curvature, Gromov-hyperbolic graphs, with application to routing, congestion, geographical localization in sensor network, and autonomous agents. Back-Pressure and Heat-Diffusion protocol in wireless networks. Quantum networks: dynamically controlled routing in spin networks. Smart grid: network approach, voltage stability, and false data injection detection.
