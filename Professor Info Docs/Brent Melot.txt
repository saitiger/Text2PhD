# position

Associate Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering and Materials Science

# biography

Melot received his Ph.D. from the Materials Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara, under the supervision of Ram Seshadri and subsequently joined the Laboratoire de Réactivité et Chimie des Solides in Amiens as a postdoctoral research associate under Jean-Marie Tarascon. Since starting his independent career in 2012, his group has focused on developing a deeper understanding of how the crystal structure and composition of materials influence their functional properties. They are broadly interested in materials for a diverse range of applications including halide perovskite light absorbers, frustrated magnetism in oxides, heterogeneous catalysts, as well as alkali and fluoride insertion hosts for energy storage.

# research_summary

Research Summary The Melot group works on all aspects of materials design, meaning that we synthesize new compounds, study their atomic structure, and characterize their functional properties. Current topics include photovoltaics, intercalation electrodes for Li-, Na-, or F-ion batteries, and heterogeneous catalysts for sustainable chemistry.
