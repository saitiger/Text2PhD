# biography

Pierluigi Nuzzo is the Kenneth C. Dahlberg Early Career Chair and an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. He received the Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) from the University of California at Berkeley in 2015. He also holds a M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pisa and the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa, Italy. 

Between August 2015 and August 2016, he was a Postdoctoral Scholar at U.C. Berkeley. Before joining U.C. Berkeley, he was a Researcher at IMEC, Leuven, Belgium, and the University of Pisa, working on the design of energy-efficient A/D converters, frequency synthesizers for reconfigurable radio, and design methodologies for mixed-signal integrated circuits. 

Prof. Nuzzo received the National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2019, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Young Faculty Award in 2020, the IEEE Technical Committee on Cyber-Physical Systems (TCCPS) Early-Career Award in 2022, the Okawa Foundation Research Grant in 2022, the Best Submission in the 2006 DAC (Design Automation Conference) and ISSCC (International Solid-State Circuit Conference) Design Competition, and Best Paper Awards from the International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS) in 2016 and the International Conference on Methods and Models for System Design (MEMOCODE) in 2020. His awards and honors also include the U.C. Berkeley EECS Ph.D. Fellowship in 2008, the U.C. Berkeley Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award in 2013, the IBM Ph.D. Fellowship in 2012 and 2014, and the U.C. Berkeley EECS David J. Sakrison Memorial Prize in 2016 for his doctoral research.
