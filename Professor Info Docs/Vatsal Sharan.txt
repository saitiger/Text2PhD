# research_summary

Research Summary I work on the foundations of machine learning, and my interests mostly lie in the intersection of machine learning, theoretical computer science and statistics. My research aims to understand fundamental limits for solving learning and estimation tasks given computational and information theoretic constraints, and to use this understanding to develop practical algorithms which are efficient, fair and robust.
