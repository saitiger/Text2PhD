# biography

I am a linguist and computational linguist. My training and early work was in theoretical linguistics, specializing in formal semantics. Since 2004, when I joined the ARRAU project (which has since ended), I have expanded my work to computational linguistics, specifically working with annotated corpora. I am presently coordinating an effort to create and organize a corpus of spoken dialogue which is used in developing language comprehension and speech of virtual humans. My research expertise is in the following fields:

Computational: corpus creation and management; reliability statistics for corpus annotation; dialogue; anaphora resolution.

Theoretical: formal semantics and semantics-prosody interaction; compositional semantics below the word level; focus; coordination; temporal quantification.
