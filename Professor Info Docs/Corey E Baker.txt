# research_summary

Research Summary I am the Director of the Network Reconnaissance Lab (NetRecon) which investigates full stack systems for distributing, protecting, and authenticating data in opportunistic networking scenarios for remote patient monitoring, smart cities, and natural disasters to improve the livelihood of people. I evaluate real-world applications of opportunistic delay tolerant networks (DTNs and human centered computing to empower device-to-device (D2D) social networks for crowd sourcing information. Leveraging opportunistic communication provides complementary solutions to traditional networks which are typically dependent upon centralized infrastructures such as the Internet. The goal of my research is to make critical data accessible to vulnerable communities
