# research_summary

Research Summary Dr. Muin’s expertise is in structural health monitoring(SHM). She is currently working in areas of response-based damage detection using machine learning, SHM sensor development, and disaster resiliency modeling. The overarching goal of her research is to develop a holistic post-disaster monitoring and recovery system that will study the data collected from the structural and human components of a community and improve the resiliency of a city. Dr Muin’s research interest lies in structural health monitoring, earthquake engineering, response of long period structures, machine learning, data-driven community resilience, disaster reconnaissance, feasible SHM sensors.
