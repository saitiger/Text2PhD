Dr. Nutt received his BS degree in physics from the University of Virginia in 1977. He received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Materials Science from the University of Virginia in 1978 and 1982, respectively. He spent two years at the National Bureau of Standards as an NRC post-doctoral research associate, followed by two years as a research professor at the HREM Facility at Arizona State University. From 1986-93 he was a member of the engineering faculty at Brown University. He currently holds the M.C. Gill Chair in Composite Materials at USC.

# research_summary

Research Summary Dr. Nutt's research group focuses on processing science for fiber-reinforced composites, including experimental determination of mechanisms (resin flow, air removal, compaction) and underlying scientific principles governing production of composite laminates and composite structures. Hallmarks of the group include in situ process diagnostics, design/build of instrumented test beds, and coupling with process modeling. The scope of research encompasses composites for aerospace, wind energy, and automotive applications, and emphasizes prepregs and liquid molding processes. Additional topics include high-temperature phenomena in composites, such as aging effects on mechanical performance, processing of ceramic composites and interface design.
