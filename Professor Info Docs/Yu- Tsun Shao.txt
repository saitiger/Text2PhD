# biography

Yu-Tsun Shao received his B.S. in Physics at National Taiwan University in 2012, a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2018, and did postdoctoral work at Cornell University. He will be joining USC as an Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science starting 2023. He is the recipient of the Robert P. Apkarian Postdoctoral Scholar Award (2021) and Presidential Student Award (2016) of the Microscopy Society of America, and the Ludo Frevel Crystallography Scholarship Award of the International Centre for Diffraction Data (2016).

# research_summary

Research Summary Research in the Shao electron microscopy group develops and applies novel electron microscopy techniques to understand materials and devices at the atomic scale. Using the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), we are able to explore structural, chemical, electronic, and topological phases in materials at the atomic scale. Our current research focuses on understanding the interplay between spin, lattice, polarization, and charge in quantum materials. Specifically, we develop and apply 4D-STEM to study multiferroic crystals with the aim to elucidate the microscopic origin of interactions among local polar/magnetic order, strain, and chiralities during topological phase transitions.
