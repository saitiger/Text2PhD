# research_summary

Research Summary I develop machine learning methods to perform efficient optimization and experimental design in costly real-world settings, where resources are limited. My work spans topics in active learning, uncertainty quantification, Bayesian decision making, and reinforcement learning. I apply these methods downstream to solve problems in science and engineering, for example in the physical sciences and machine learning systems. I have also worked on distributed algorithms for scalable machine learning, and I develop/maintain software libraries for multilevel optimization, uncertainty quantification, AutoML, and Bayesian optimization.
