# research_summary

Research Summary Dr. Ghadami's research interest focuses on developing data-driven and artificial intelligence techniques to predict, design, and control the dynamics of complex systems. The ultimate goal is to ensure the systems can best withstand undesirable and unexpected outcomes in their dynamics. These developments range from predicting catastrophic phenomena in the dynamics of natural and engineered systems to analysis and improving the resilience of multi-agent system dynamics while operating in uncertain environments. Research areas: Dynamical systems and control, Data-driven methods, Multi-agent systems
