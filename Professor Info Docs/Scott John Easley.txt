Research Summary Visual Simulation, interactive media, edutainment and aiding disabilities with video games. The main focus of my work is how visual media prepares, instructs, changes or fulfills our need for social interaction and entertainment. A primary need for this is an efficient system for delivering a constant array of new models, textures, and data into a large pipeline that is malleable throughout several production cycles.
