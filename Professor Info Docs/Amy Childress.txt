Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering

# biography

Dr. Childress joined the Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) Department in summer 2013 as professor and director of CEE's environmental engineering program. Dr. Childress currently serves on the AEESP Foundation Board of Directors and previously served as the AEESP President. She earned her bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the University of Maryland and her master's degree and PhD in civil and environmental engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Childress was previously professor and chair of the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at the University of Nevada, Reno.
For the past 20 years, Professor Childress' research and scholarly interests have been in the area of membrane processes for desalination, water treatment, and wastewater reclamation. Professor Childress has directed research projects funded by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, NSF, NASA, Office of Naval Research, U.S. Department of Energy, California Energy Commission, California Department of Water Resources, the U.S. EPA, and SERDP, as well as local and private agencies.
She leads a research group that has produced numerous peer-reviewed publications, proceeding papers, and patents

# research_summary

Research Summary Dr. Childress' research addresses the global challenge of fresh water scarcity. Her current research interests focus on membrane contactor processes for innovative solutions to contaminant and energy challenges; pressure-driven membrane processes as industry standards for desalination and water reuse; membrane bioreactor technology; and colloidal and interfacial aspects of membrane processes. Dr. Childress looks forward to addressing wastewater reclamation and seawater desalination challenges that occur in southern California and around the world. Improvements to drinking water treatment and wastewater reclamation processes are critical for achieving fresh water supply goals. Further, process sustainability through the reduction of discharge by-products to
