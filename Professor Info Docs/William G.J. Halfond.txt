# research_summary

Research Summary William Halfond's work has broadly focused on developing techniques that help developers to improve the quality of their web and mobile apps. In particular, his group's work has focused on areas that have become of increasing importance: energy consumption, appearance of the user interface (UI), and security. For energy consumption, their work has focused on techniques that enable developers to understand and change their mobile apps' energy consumption; leading to the development of techniques that provide developers with fine-grained insight into how energy is consumed by their apps and help them to make changes that can save significant
