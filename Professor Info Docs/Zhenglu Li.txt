# position

Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science

# biography

Dr. Zhenglu Li received his B.S. in physics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2012. He received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of California at Berkeley in 2019. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California at Berkeley from 2019 - 2022. Beginning in 2023, Dr. Li joined the Mork Family Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science as an Assistant Professor.

# research_summary

Research Summary Dr. Li's research group is broadly interested in developing and applying massively-parallelized computational methods based on many-body quantum theories to study excited-state properties of materials, including bulk solids and two-dimensional systems. His group focuses on the developments of the first-principles approaches including the GW perturbation theory and time-dependent GW method, and their broad applications in quantum materials. These ab initio computational methods provide accurate many-electron-level descriptions of important phenomena such as electron-phonon coupling, superconductivity, nonequilibrium exciton dynamics, exciton-phonon coupling, and light-matter interactions. Dr. Li is particularly interested in the role of electron-phonon coupling in materials with strong electron
