# research_summary

Research Summary Dr. Nweke focuses on applying components of data analytics (including statistical analysis, machine learning, and database management) to solve problems at the intersection of geotechnical engineering, earthquake engineering, seismology, and geomorphology. His research interests are modeling geo-materials, and investigating seismic and other natural hazards at the local (site) and regional scales. This includes characterizing sedimentary basin effects in earthquake ground motions, assessing and evaluating physics-based earthquake simulations, and investigating the mechanical behavior (static and dynamic) of bio-cemented soils. Additional applications include 1) earthquake ground motion spatial variability on the performance of lifeline infrastructure systems, 2) novel data acquisition
