Research Summary Previous work has shown that breathing rate, airflow pattern shape, and the end-expiratory lung volume level can be predicted by an optimal control model based on minimum power expenditure. One prediction which is important to the control of breathing during exercise is a decrease in end-expiratory lung volume level which is graded according to the level of exercise. Such a decrease is consistently observed at the start of exercise and occurs in a feedforward or predictive manner. One of the consequences of a decreased lung volume is lengthening of the diaphragm, which according to the length-tension characteristics of
