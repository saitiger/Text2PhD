# position

Associate Professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering and Computer Science, Viterbi Early Career Chair in Engineering

# biography

I am a WiSE Gabilan Assistant Professor, an Assistant Professor of Industrial & Systems Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Southern California, and an Associate Director of the CAIS Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society. Prior to joining USC, I was a lecturer in the Operations Research and Statistics Group at the MIT Sloan School of Management, and a postdoctoral research associate in the Operations Research Center at MIT. I hold a PhD degree in Operations Research and an MEng degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering, both from Imperial College London.

# research_summary

Research Summary My research is focused on optimization, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, in particular on algorithmic fairness, interpretability, and robustness. My mission is to design systems that drive efficient decision-making while addressing bias and inequality, to tackle problems such as homelessness, substance use, suicide prevention, and organ allocation. My work strives to better assist underserved and marginalized communities in these areas by giving them an active role in the design of the AI systems that affect them. I am a recipient of the NSF CAREER award and the USC Viterbi Junior Research Award and, jointly with my students, earned
