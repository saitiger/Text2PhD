# research_summary

Research Summary The Computational Systems Biology Laboratory at USC develops mechanistic models of biological processes and utilize the models to: - gain insight into the dynamics and regulation of biological systems - synthesize and interpret experimental and clinical observations - provide a quantitative framework to test biological hypotheses - contribute to the development of novel therapeutics for pathological conditions We collaborate closely with experimental and clinical researchers, in order to construct experimentally validated computational models that increase our understanding of specific biological processes. These fruitful collaborations enable experimental testing of the model predictions. The main projects are focused on applying
