# research_summary

Research Summary Dr. Dong Song's research interests include nonlinear dynamical modeling of the nervous system, hippocampal memory prosthesis, neural interface technologies, and development of novel modeling strategies incorporating both statistical and mechanistic modeling methods. He invented the multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear dynamical model of spike transformation that serves as the computational basis of hippocampal memory prostheses.
