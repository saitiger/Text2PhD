# research_summary

Research Summary Dr. Leahy's research interests lie in the application of signal and image processing theory to the formation and analysis of biomedical images. His research group is currently involved in the development and analysis of computational methods for formation of positron emission tomography (PET) images with applications in clinical oncology and gene expression imaging in small animals. For the past 15 years, Dr. Leahy has been involved in the development of inverse method for spatio-temporal imaging of neural activity from measurements of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data. The results of this research are distributed to the research community
